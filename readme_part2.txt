* Analysis: 
* 1. What digit is misclassified the most frequently? 
	From my testing, 7 and 1 were classified the most frequently.
* 2. For this digit, what are the top two digits that your 
* MultiPerceptron incorrectly predicts?
	For 1 it would incorrectly predict either 2 or 3, while 7 incorrectly predicted 2 consistently.
* 3. Examine some of these misclassified images. Provide an
 explanation for what might have caused these misclassifications.
After examining the images, one explanation could be that the shapes of the 2 different numbers depending on the style 
can be very similar, thus confusing the system.

2. Top two digits misclassified are:1, 7
3. Explanation:
